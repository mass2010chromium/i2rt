# Grippers

YAM supports five interchangeable end-effector options. The gripper type is specified when creating the robot:

```python
from i2rt.robots.get_robot import get_yam_robot
from i2rt.robots.utils import GripperType

robot = get_yam_robot(channel="can0", gripper_type=GripperType.LINEAR_4310)
```

## Gripper Reference

### `crank_4310`

Zero-linkage crank gripper powered by the DM4310 motor. The crank mechanism minimizes the total gripper width — ideal for reaching into tight spaces.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Motor | DM4310 |
| Mechanism | Zero-linkage crank |
| Calibration | Not required — fixed limits (0.0 to -2.7 rad) |
| PD Gains | kp=20, kd=0.5 |
| Best for | Narrow workspace, minimizing sweep width |

---

### `linear_3507`

Lightweight linear gripper with a DM3507 motor. Smaller and lighter than the 4310 variant.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Motor | DM3507 |
| Mechanism | Linear actuator |
| Calibration | **Required** — auto-detected on startup |
| PD Gains | kp=10, kd=0.3 |
| Best for | Weight-sensitive setups |

::: warning Calibration required
Because the motor travels more than 2pi radians over the full stroke, the `linear_3507` needs to know its start position. On startup, the SDK automatically runs a calibration routine that moves the gripper in both directions to detect limits. Ensure the gripper can move freely during initialization.

### `linear_4310`

Standard linear gripper with the heavier DM4310 motor. Slightly more gripping force than the 3507.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Motor | DM4310 |
| Mechanism | Linear actuator |
| Calibration | **Required** — same auto-calibration as `linear_3507` |
| PD Gains | kp=20, kd=0.5 |
| Best for | General-purpose tasks, higher force |

### `yam_teaching_handle`

The leader arm handle — not a manipulation gripper, but a hand controller for teleoperation.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Trigger | Controls follower gripper open/close |
| Top button | Enable/disable arm synchronization |
| Second button | User-programmable |

For full usage — trigger reading, encoder calibration, and teleoperation setup — see the [YAM Leader Arm](/products/yam-leader) page.

---

### `no_gripper`

Arm-only configuration with no end effector. Use when the application doesn't require grasping.

```python
robot = get_yam_robot(gripper_type=GripperType.NO_GRIPPER)
# robot.num_dofs() returns 6 (arm joints only)
```

## Gripper Models

MuJoCo XML models for each gripper. Arm and gripper models are combined at runtime:

```
i2rt/robot_models/gripper/

│   ├── crank_4310.xml
│   └── assets/link_6_collision.stl

└── no_gripper/
    └── no_gripper.xml
```

## Gripper Force Limiting

The SDK includes automatic gripper force limiting when the gripper is clogged (stalled against an object). This is enabled by default with `limit_gripper_force=50.0` N. The system monitors motor effort and speed to detect when the gripper has hit an object, then limits the applied torque accordingly.
